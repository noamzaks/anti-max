_Make sure you speak appropriately_

## Getting Started

- Get one of the releases or clone the repository and install the dependencies with `npm install`:
- Create a configuration JSON which looks like so (with correct phone numbers):

```json
{
  "mackPhoneNumber": "972541234567",
  "myPhoneNumber": "972541234567"
}
```

- Start the bot with `node index.js` or by running the binary you downloaded.

Good luck!
